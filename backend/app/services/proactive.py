Proactive / backhaul matching: scans trucks currently ON_TRIP and looks
for WAITING_FOR_MATCH loads whose origin equals the truck's trip
destination, within an ETA window (default ±60 min, see
PROACTIVE_MATCH_WINDOW_MINUTES). Deliberately coarse -- this is a
"might be a fit, admin confirms" signal, not a precise scheduling system.
