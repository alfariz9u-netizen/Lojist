"""
FastAPI backend entrypoint. Only the bot process/webhook, the cron
pinger, and internal workers ever call this API -- see
core/security.verify_bot_secret (required on every /internal/* route
except /internal/cron/tick, which has its own CRON_SECRET) and
api/telegram_webhook.py (its own TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET). No debug
info or stack traces are exposed to callers in production.

Two deployment shapes, both served by this same app (see
core/config.Settings.bot_mode):
  - BOT_MODE=polling: bot runs as its own separate process
    (docker-compose's `bot` service) long-polling Telegram -- this app
    only ever exposes the internal API. Suited to a VPS/always-on VM.
  - BOT_MODE=webhook: this app ALSO builds the Telegram bot on startup
    and exposes POST /telegram/webhook for it, and the standalone
    `worker` process is replaced by an external pinger hitting
    POST /internal/cron/tick every few minutes. Suited to a free,
    single-web-service host with no standalone background workers.
