"""
Trusted pairs: once the admin manually connects a shipper and a carrier
for the first time (the "✅ تم الربط" action, see api/admin.py), any
FUTURE match between that same shipper and that same carrier is
auto-connected -- see services/notifications.process_new_match(). This
does not weaken the privacy model: the two parties already exchanged
contact info once, under admin supervision, so showing it to them again
on a repeat match isn't a new exposure. It only removes the friction of
making the admin manually re-approve a relationship they already vetted.

A pair is NEVER created automatically from matching/scoring, and never
creatable by either party -- only mark_trusted(), called exclusively
from the admin "connect" action, writes one.
